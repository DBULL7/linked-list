# Project Synopsis
#For this project we were tasked with creating and bookmarking system for the users favorite websites. There is a form with 2 input fields for the user to enter a title and a valid url for a website. Upon submitting the form, a new index card is created and housed in a designated section of the page. These cards can be classified as 'read' or 'unread' as well as deleted from the inventory.
